Based on i3Extra by nepeee

This is a modified version of the Marlin 1.1.1 firmware for the WANHAO Duplicator i3 Plus 3d printer.
Currently it's in alpha state, same lcd functions are working and some of them is not.

If you like to help us to make a better software for the printer don't hesitate to contribute in this project!
